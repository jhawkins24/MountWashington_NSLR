# MountWashington_NSLR
Code used to calculate the near-surface lapse rate on Mount Washington, NH as part of a Mount Washington Observatory internship in the fall of 2022.

Data analyzed were from the Mount Washington Observatory's Regional Mesonet stations along the Mount Washington Auto Road

NSLRs were calculated for each meteorological season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) for daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures from the Mesonet sites.

Once calculated, seasonal NSLRs were compared between seasons and to the global average environmental lapse rate for teach temperature type.
